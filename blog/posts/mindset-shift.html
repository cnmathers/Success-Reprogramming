    <section class="post-content">
      <p>You've been running on outdated code — beliefs and limitations that were embedded before you were aware they even existed. This post is about finding that root directory and rewriting it.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>“If your programming wasn't installed by you, it’s time for a recompile.”</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>🔍 Identify Your Limiting Scripts</h2>
      <p>Look at the thoughts that run on loop. The silent scripts that say “I can’t,” “I shouldn’t,” “I’m not good enough.” These aren’t facts. They’re injected code from broken systems.</p>
      <p>Maybe these limiting beliefs were put there by well meaning adults trying to protect you as a child. Maybe by a teacher who didn't see your talent.</p>
      <p>But that doesn't matter now. Those thoughts, that old code, if it isn't working for you, then it needs to be updated.</p>

      <h2>💡 Write New Functions</h2>
      <p>Instead of:
        <br><code>function selfWorth() { return externalValidation; }</code>
        <br>Write:
        <br><code>function selfWorth() { return internalTruth; }</code>
      </p>
      <p>Here's the truth. Your self-worth comes from your mindset. What you believe about yourself dictates how yoou move in the world.</p>
      <p>You're never gonna make everybody happy. And living small to please someone who let their dream fail? That's outdated code. It no longer serves its purpose.</p>
      
      <h2>Repetition is Reprogramming</h2>
      <p>Affirmations. Audio. Visual cues. Embed new beliefs like a repeating script in your OS. Overwrite until overwrite is default.</p>
      <p>But here's the deal. You have to use emotion.</p>
      <p>Without emotion, you can't tell your subsconcious that your updated code is valid. That its real.</p>
      <p>Remeber the first time someone told you that you couldn't do it? You could be an astronaut because you weren't smart enough? Or you're not good enough for the team?</p>
      <p>You felt that. And your subconscious took it and programmed it into your character.</p>
      <p>Now it time to do the reverse.</p>
      <p>See the future you in your mind. The real you. Speak what you see outloud. Write it down. Live like this version of you already exists... because it does.</p>
      <p>Do this with powerful emotion and you'll see a shift from the old code into the new you.</p>

      <p>You're not broken. You're just running someone else's version of you. Time to install the upgrade.</p>
